      <b>Welcome to the 2023 holiday card!</b> As many of you are aware, I’m Andrew. 
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="p">
      Since some of you are abroad, I’ve decided to make a card that highlights one of the most important values of the season: <b>streamlined efficiency</b>. Where there was previously sharp, dangerous card stock and messy, expensive ink, I’ve transformed the medium to this static generated site you can view on any <b>cold, lifeless screen</b> you have within arm’s reach!</div> 
    <br>

    <br>
    <div class="p"> Good questions. I can tell you are on edge, and justifiably so.</div>
    <br>
   <div class="p2">
   a) This holiday card is addressed to relatives I have seen over the course of 2023. Whether that involved having post-Christmas tacos, enjoying Cajun Pho in a Federal Way strip mall, eating Cuban Sandwiches in Seattle, having Filipino Sushi in Long Beach (that I <em>don’t</em> think about on a daily basis) or finding surprisingly authentic Chinese food in easternmost Washington. But the food is just a peripheral element to my favorite restaurant: <b>our friendship</b>. (this is true. But I have to keep up the joke-y tone of the overall piece).</div>
   
   <br>
   
   <div class="p2">
	 <p>b) It’s the holiday season and because I now live a <b>coddled, academic existence</b>, I’ve been afforded the time to innovate in the rapidly expanding ‘holiday card space’.</p> </div>

   <div class="p">
   Still suspicious, then?

   If you click on the menu bar, you will find your <b>"yuletide module.”</b> These consist of:</div> <br>
   
   <div class="p2">
    a) <b>“Christmas Thoughts”:</b> A brief reflection I’ve written after meditating for no less than 10-15 minutes on “Festive Concepts”, such as:</div>
    <br>
    <div class="p3">
    - <em>Hearths</em><br></div>
    <div class="p3">
		- <em>Tinsel</em> (PVC or polyvinyl chloride coated with a thin layer of metal, such as aluminum)<br></div>
    <div class="p3">
    - <em>Baubles, Knick-Knacks, Tchotchkes, etc.</em><br></div>
<br>
    <div class="p">
      <b>and</b> 
    </div>  
<br>
    <div class="p2">
    b) A signature <b>“Holiday Dish”</b> I've mentally hand-curated for you that I promise to make the next time we see each other (even if you don’t want me to), which I hope will be soon!
    
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="p">
    Wishing you all a wonderful holiday season and a very happy, fulfilling New Year! </div>
    <br>
    <div class="p">
    Love,
    </div>

P.S.
If you are wondering what the banner image is from, please enjoy this restored version of the very first multiverse movie: <em>A Muppet Family Christmas</em> (1987), wherein the Muppets, the Sesame Street gang and the Fraggles melt your tepid heart with <b>pure chaos</b>.

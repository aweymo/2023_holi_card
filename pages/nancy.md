## Christmas Thoughts

<div class="p4">
Lovely to see you this Thanksgiving! Thanks so much for making the trip out – it really meant a lot. Thanks also for the fiestaware. I will have to have people over just to show off that serving dish (hopefully featuring something corned, possibly beef).

I hope you enjoyed <b>The 5000 Fingers of Dr. T</b>. film I shared. It reminded me a little of some more innovative european cinema you have recommended to me in the past – but made by a New York film director for Dr. Seuss during one of the stodgiest periods of American cinema. It’s so funny how much it was reviled at the time of release – like there was some dissonance between how strange Dr. Seuss actually is when you see it in live action rather than drawn? Although all of the performances are only adequate, some of those set designs absolutely belong in a museum.

The British name for bacon wrapped prunes or dates (pictured here with a little brie, which I think is a nice touch). So named most likely because they are reddish and served piping hot. You could enjoy these with deviled eggs for a full <b>satanic finger food</b> course or enjoy with the dish’s counterpart Angels On Horseback (bacon wrapped oysters) if you would like to engage in a kind of a <b>culinary War in Heaven</b>, as depicted here by Hieronymus Bosch.

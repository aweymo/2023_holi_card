## Christmas Thoughts

<div class="p4">
It was great seeing you this Thanksgiving! Thanks so much for taking the long road trip out to Moscow and your signature <b>“turkey tips”</b>. I recently went to a party where I was invited to bring an instrument and I took the charango, which was a big hit! An excellent instrument for inauspiciously noodling in the background to familiar XMAS songs you don’t actually know how to play. Thanks again for sending that up from Peru!

Sending you both a copy of <a href= "https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/152034931">this book</a> from a humorist I like. Even though I liked it quite a bit, Werner Herzog’s memoir might be a little heavy for the holiday season.

## Your Holiday Dish

Selected for you because it’s from Santa Fe – but the one in Spain – <b>Pionono</b>!

Little toasted cream, syrupy pastries. Like cappuccinos, these are riffing on papal hats and hairstyles, with the cream top resembling the pope’s super cool, sans pinwheel beanie.

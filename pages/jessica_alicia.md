## Christmas Thoughts

<div class="p4">
Great to see you both earlier this year! Thanks so much for your hospitality and excellent food.

Although the holiday season is a time of celebration and gratitude for what you have, it’s also a time to acknowledge and process loss. I am, of course, talking about  <a href= "https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/looff-s-lite-a-line"><b>Looff’s Lite-A-Line</b></a>, that I visited when I was in town, not knowing that it would shutter soon after, drawing it's 80-year legacy as a somewhat legal gambling institution to a close. Though you both never had a chance to visit, <b>take solace in this:</b> it’s one of those weird, old places (like the Chowder Barge) that I’m very drawn towards but you both would probably find <b>vaguely dingy and sad </b>(which they are and were).

## Your Holiday Dish

<div class="p4">
<b>Buñuelo!</b>

A slight regional variation on your holiday tradition. A wheat based yeast fritter usually containing anise but with a smattering of international interpretations including islands off the coast of southern Spain incorporating sweet potato, cheese and dried figs. The name derives from Germanic Goth <em>buggjō</em>, meaning <b>“lump,”</b> which derives from <em>*bʰenǵʰ</em>, meaning <b>“thick, dense, fat”</b>. Perfect marketing. I’m fully on board.

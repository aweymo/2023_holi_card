## Christmas Thoughts

<div class="p4">
It was great seeing you this year. Thanks so much for having me over to your place in Seattle and cooking such a wonderful dinner. 
</div>

<div class="p4">
The holidays are an excellent time to think back and reconcile things from the past, which leads me, of course, to <em>Legends of the Hidden Temple</em>, the 1993-1995 Nickelodeon adventure game show that was shocked back to life for me when I noticed you watching it on IG.

<br>
<div class="p4">
As a petulant 12 year old, I was a real Monday morning quarterback about the whole show; extremely critical of contestants and positive that I would dominate the kind of <b>bootcamp-by-way-of-Indiana-Jones</b> courses if I were given half a chance. In the spirit of the holiday, I will rectify that my motor skills didnâ€™t align in any way with my self-confidence and I would have likely <b>immediately concussed myself</b>.

## Your Holiday Dish

<b>Hamanado!</b>

<div class="p4">
A Filipino predecessor to a mid century American classic, the <b>merging of ham and pineapple</b>. In this version, pork is marinated overnight in a pineapple, brown sugar and soy sauce, pan fried until browned, simmered in stock until tender and served with rice.

<div class="p4">
Savory and sweet can be a divisive thing but this feels much more like real deal produce that has equal sweet and sour, slow cooking for hours -- as opposed to some canned pineapple chunks on a Domino's pizza.
